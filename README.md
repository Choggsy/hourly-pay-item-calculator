# hourly-pay-item-calculator
As an experienced Java and mobile developer, I wanted to explore Go for my new job role by building something simple but useful: 
a CLI tool (command line interface) that calculates how many hours of work an item or service costs. 
You enter your hourly wage and the item's price, and it tells you how long you'd need to work to afford it.

## Development Log

1. download GO language (https://go.dev/dl/), I have the Windows version
2. For IDE's, my favourite is always Jetbrains IntelliJ IDEA. There is a GO plugin which is what il be using for this project.
3. Run go mod init [repository name], this set up declares the project as GO but also acts as the dependency manager like Maven or Gradle in other stacks.
4. Start writing some code! .... and now refer to my debug log ðŸ˜‚
5. Now for tests starting on extracted logic... ideally I'd write tests first but since im learning the language I won't be attempting TDD today
6. Unit testing is similar enough to Junit. IntelliJ is very helpful to creating test functioning using alt + insert. or ctrl + shift + t to make and locate test files. Not loving how Go structures unit tests in the same package as the unit being tested instead of a separate test package like in java. I have found how to make 'nested' classes in the test file like in java, i like how the test cases for t.run () have more readable names then the test function naming convention
7. 7. Extracted out common testing logic like `t.Errorf(message,expected,result)` into a live template. 
8. finished basic CLI tool. now making new requirements for additional features and an improved web front end
